# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a project developed as an assignment for a full-stack web development course on The Odin Project. It is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. You can access the live version of the game [here](https://tictactoe-odin.netlify.app/).

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Play
- The game starts with 'X' as the first player.
- Click on any square to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').
- The game will automatically switch turns between 'X' and 'O'.
- The first player to align three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If no player achieves a winning condition and the board is filled, the game ends in a tie.

## Files
- `index.html`: Contains the structure and content of the game interface.
- `style.css`: Contains the styles for the game interface.
- `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Code Overview
- The game logic is implemented using JavaScript.
- The HTML file provides the structure for the game board and messages.
- CSS is used for styling the game elements.
- The JavaScript file manages the game state, handles player turns, determines winners, and updates the UI accordingly.

## Credits
- This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum, an open-source educational platform for learning web development.
